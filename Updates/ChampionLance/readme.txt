Hello!  My name is TheNerdyBirdy.  Thank you for downloading the Champion Lance ghost! :)  He's based off of Champion Lance from the Pokemon series, specifically a slightly AU version of him from the askblog Crewel-Intentions.  This version of Lance is still cheerful and confident, but he is a bit more smug and arrogant, and his backstory is a bit different than canon.

--Content Warnings--
Unreality/Paranoia - Some fourth wall breaking.  Lance will comment on certain applications you have open and talk as if he can see what you are doing

--Features--
- Custom pronouns and username:  When first introducing himself, Lance will ask for your name and pronouns
- Learns about you:  Lance will sometimes ask you questions, and then bring up those answers in later conversations! (TO BE ADDED)
- Interactions: By mousing over Lance you can pet him, while clicking on him will poke him.  I will eventually be adding questions you can ask him so you can interact with him further
- Open Programs: Can open Calculator, Notepad, and Task Manager
- Online Search: Can search online for things and will comment on certain searches
- Set Desktop Wallpaper: Dragging an image to him will let him set that image as your wallpaper
- Empty Recycling Bin
- Custom Reminders: Can be set as one time, daily, weekly, or monthly (TO BE ADDED)
