Hello!  My name is TheNerdyBirdy.  Thank you for downloading the Eclipse ghost! :)  He's based off of Balloon World Eclipse from Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach.  He's sassy, snarky, and a bit mischievous and flirty.  He claims to be a virus, but rest assured, he's not actually a virus and his files are 100% safe to use and download.  That's just his shtick!  As for right now, he can only do a few basic ghost functions, but one day I would like to implement a relationship system with him.

--Content Warnings--
Unreality/Paranoia - Lots of fourth wall breaking and meta themes.  Eclipse claims to be a virus and will sometimes talk about files on your computer and how your computer is running.  He will also comment on programs you have open, but this specific feature can be disabled in his menu.  Eclipse is perfectly safe: he is not an actual virus.  He cannot manipulate your computer or any of your files aside from setting images as your background, emptying your Recycle Bin, and opening a few basic programs, all of which are standard functions that any ghost can do.

--Features--
- Custom pronouns and username:  When first introducing himself, Eclipse will ask for your name and pronouns
- Learns about you:  Eclipse will sometimes ask you questions, and then bring up those answers in later conversations! (TO BE ADDED)
- Interactions: By mousing over Eclipse you can pet him, while clicking on him will poke him.  I will eventually be adding questions you can ask him so you can interact with him further
- Relationship System: Eclipse will grow closer to you as talk and interact with him!  He will react differently and say different things. (TO BE ADDED)
- Open Programs: Can open Calculator, Notepad, and Task Manager
- Set Desktop Wallpaper: Dragging an image to him will let him set that image as your wallpaper
- Empty Recycling Bin
- Custom Reminders: Can be set as one time, daily, weekly, or monthly (TO BE ADDED)
- Work Timers: Sets a timer with built in breaks. (TO BE ADDED)
